# Explanation of Chat Loop Behavior

When handling chat messages in the script, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Receiving Messages**: The script listens for the `RecvMessage` event, which is triggered whenever a new message is received in the chat.

2. **Logging Messages**: Upon receiving a message, the script logs the content of the message using `Chat.log()`. This action sends the message to the chat window.

3. **Triggering RecvMessage Again**: The act of logging a message to the chat window can trigger the `RecvMessage` event again, as the logged message is treated as a new message in the chat.

4. **Infinite Loop Creation**: This creates a feedback loop where each logged message triggers another `RecvMessage` event, leading to the script continuously processing and logging messages without an exit condition.

5. **Non-Responsive Behavior**: As the loop continues indefinitely, the script may become non-responsive, consuming resources and potentially freezing the chat interface.

## Conclusion

To prevent this infinite loop, it is crucial to implement checks that differentiate between original messages and those generated by the script itself. This can be achieved by adding conditions to ignore messages that the script has logged or by using flags to manage the state of message processing.
